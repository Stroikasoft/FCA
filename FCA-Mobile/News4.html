              The Federal Customs Authority (FCA) of the United Arab Emirates signed on Monday a memorandum of understanding with the Regional Intelligence Liaison Offices (RILO) of the World Customs Organization (WCO) to exchange intelligence over customs busts in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.   
 The signing of the MoU aims to enhance cooperation with the countries of the region in exchanging intelligence over customs busts and fighting customs smuggling and to achieve the FCA strategic goals of protecting society security, facilitating trade and boosting cooperation with the outside world, said Khalid A. Al Bustani, FCA Acting Director General.
 Under the MoU, Al Bustani said, liaison officers will be appointed to coordinate and implement the process of exchanging customs intelligence between the FCA and local customs departments on the one hand and RILO on the other to boost communications between both parties.
 As an active member of the WCO, the UAE plays a significant role in the world trade map as a regional trade hub linking between the Middle East, North Africa, the Near East and the world, Al Bustani said.
 The UAE is keen to sign the MoU with RILO and boost the efforts exerted by the state to promote customs risk management, fight cheat and smuggling, protect the consumers against improper customs practices, he said.   
 Saudi-based RILO plays a major role in exchanging intelligence and experience over the customs busts as a part of the WCO's Customs Enforcement Network (CEN), he said. It provides support for local liaison offices at the member states and ensures that the intelligence of regional customs busts is regularly entered into the CEN, he said.
 "RILO verifies the intelligence of regional busts, issues analyses of these busts to support the customs departments in the member states; collects, evaluates and publishes intelligence over customs violations, issues regular newsletters of the regional and global busts and analyzes smuggling trends in the region", he said.      
 RILO seeks to encourage cooperation with the relevant agencies and organizations at the region in accordance with the rules and regulations set by the CEN in the WCO, said the FCA Acting Director General. It also seeks to help the customs authorities in their analysis operations in certain issues and improve the exchange of intelligence in the relevant issues in accordance with the legal conditions and regulations of the local or regional authorities, he said.
 The exchange of intelligence is one of the most important customs pillars for fighting drug and chemical trafficking and the trade fraud, Al Bustani stressed. RILO Middle East has been established based on the recommendations of the WCO member departments for exchanging, analyzing and distributing intelligence as a part of the customs work at the global level.
 RILO Middle East Director Faisal bin Saud Al Mujaish said that the UAE plays a strategic role at the level of world trade map thanks to its special location at the heart of the trade hubs and on the new trade lines.
 The partnership in exchange of customs intelligence is a key to build bridges between the customs departments and partners by encouraging a transparent customs environment that contributes to economic development and social welfare, he stressed.
 RILO program, Al Mujaish said, involves cooperation between three integrated levels: WCO secretariat, RILOs and local liaison offices. The WCO established 11 regional offices at the world level; most notably RILO Riyadh linking between 10 local offices at the Gulf States in addition to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, he said.
 RILO global network is a value added source and a great contribution in customs intelligence as an effective means of communications between member states, he said.
 The WCO reports lauded the achievements of RILO Middle East and the customs of member states, he said. The customs of member states were listed among the top ten customs authorities worldwide in terms of using the CEN, the number of busts and quantities busted in 2012, he said.   </div>
