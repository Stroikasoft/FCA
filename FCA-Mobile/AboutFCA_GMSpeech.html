                    <h3>
                        Strong boost toward the future
                    </h3>
                    <br />
                    Based on the wise policy of the UAE that has been established by the late Sheikh
                    Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the sound directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa
                    bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the State (may Allah protect him), and tactful
                    follow-up by His Highness Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President
                    and Prime Minister and the Ruler of Dubai (may Allah safeguard him), the Federal
                    Customs Authority (FCA) in the UAE has made as strategic objectives the establishment
                    of a balance between the security of society and fair trade, in addition to enhancement
                    of cooperation with other countries across the world.<br />
                    <br />
                    Customs work has recently been serving as the backbone of security and trade. Success
                    will add value to the national economy and boost stability and progress. On this
                    basis, the FCA worked on promoting the customs work to the best international standards
                    so as to establish a safe society and facilitated trade. The FCA always aims to
                    achieve this through developing customs policies and legislation, supervising their
                    application and having effective participation overseas to boost trade and confront
                    fraud and smuggling.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Over the past few years, the FCA has succeeded through the toil and labor of its
                    employees in establishing a high efficiency and quality federal customs system.
                    It has also left a clear and effective impact on the course of the GCC Customs and
                    the work of Arab and international customs, through its participation in various
                    committees on customs affairs.<br />
                    <br />
                    However, the future remains tied to more challenges at economic and security levels,
                    and - in the meantime – fraught with several hopes and ambitions for raising the
                    banner of the UAE high in the global trade arena.<br />
                    <br />
                    His Highness Sheikh Muhammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum has recently gave a strong boost
                    to the federal and government procedures to go well into the future by announcing
                    an initiative to shift from the e-government to the smart government in 2014, to
                    achieve welfare to the UAE nationals and residents.
                    <br />
                    And in response to the set strategic objectives, the authority&#39;s internet website
                    is launched in its new form with the purpose of achieving greater connectivity between
                    the FCA and the local and international individuals and institutions, hoping that
                    its contents would contribute to the achievement of the desired objectives and portrayal
                    of a sound image of the UAE and the customs sector in the perfect manner.
